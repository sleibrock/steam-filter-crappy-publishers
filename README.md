Steam Filter for Crappy Publishers
---

Are you tired of watching the games industry be subject to capitalists, subjecting honest game developers to burnout, layoffs and shitty wages? Me too. Here's a script to blacklist publishers who suck. Definitions of suck:

* Timed exclusives
* Laying off studios after acquisition
* Games infested with battle passes of microtransactions
* Third-party launchers
* DRM such as Denuvo, making games perform worse for no reason

## Installation

This is a [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) script so install Greasemonkey on your favorite browser. I am not linking the Chrome version, because you should not use Chrome, which is published by Google, another terrible corporation that is largely anti-human. [Use Firefox](https://getfirefox.com/).

Install the script in Greasemonkey, and browse Steam through your browser. Functionally, this inspects the current browser's window on a game and looks at the publisher. If it hits a publisher match, it will show an alert and disable all purchase buttons.
